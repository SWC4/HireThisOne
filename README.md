What do you do when you have the skills to do a job, but not the right portfolio pieces to get the job?


Make them yourself.


Over a decade ago, I set out with the goal of being an animator. I was dedicated to the art and science of production, studied all the tools, and even branched into graphic design, web development, product design, and so much more. I freelanced for a hundred different clients in a decade, writing, coding, animating, editing, and building a portfolio of work and a reputation for excellence. Over that decade of work, I saw layoffs at the big studios, layoffs in the games industry, and a market where my end goal of working somewhere big like Disney, Dreamworks, or Insomniac started to look like a bad idea. How many artists get the rugs pulled right from under them when a production finishes? 


I want to pivot my skills into the field of Technical Writing. I am excelent at research and communication, my skills in python, C++, PHP, and such are good enough to make things work, and I'm no novice in writing. I know enough to read and reverse engineer code, understand it, and explain it. I've even written a manual for building a tiny home for one of my clients. My skills are perfect for the job, if only I had a way to make that case to recruiters and hiring managers.


If the problem is proof of my abilities, why don't I just make it?


# So what is this site, exactly?


This site will host a mix of the work I've created throughout my freelance career and new work created specifically to showcase my abilities as a writer for prospective employers.

What new work? Half of this website's purpose is to be a Guide for creating and deploying your own website like it. That's right, this website is its own documentation. As I fill in the content and update material, the site's own web pages will contain the step by step process used for making it.

I'll also include my work in animation and writing about my experiences. And attempt some social media marketing as (@HireThisOne)[https://bsky.app/profile/hirethis.one].

Jump in and enjoy the ride.

This site will eventually go live at [https\://HireThis.One](https://HireThis.One)
