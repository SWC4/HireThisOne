What do you do when you have the skills to do a job, but not the right portfolio pieces to get the job?


Make them yourself.


Over a decade ago, I set out with the goal of being an animator. I was dedicated to the art and science of production, studied all the tools, and even branched into graphic design, web development, product design, and so much more. I freelanced for a hundred different clients in a decade, writing, coding, animating, editing, and building a portfolio of work and a reputation for excellence. Over that decade of work, I saw layoffs at the big studios, layoffs in the games industry, and a market where my end goal of working somewhere big like Disney, Dreamworks, or Insomniac started to look like a bad idea. How many artists get the rugs pulled right from under them when a production finishes? 


The good news is that I am broadly skilled, with experience in: C++, Python, PHP, Javascript, Fedora, Redhat, Ubuntu, Unity, basicaly the full Adobe Suite, Blender, Substance 3D, and much more. I've troubleshooted technical issues in Australia from my home in PA, salvaged footage ruined by a bad camera setting, and walked hundreds of people through the challenges of production, copywriting, and coding. Every day I add new skills to my quiver. This project is a new skill: using Astro to build and deploy a website on Cloudflare Pages or Cloudflare Workers. I've done static sites on AWS, so this time I'll try Cloudflare.


I want to pivot my skills into the field of Technical Writing. I am excelent at research and communication. I know enough languages to understand code and spit out comments or documentation. I've even written a manual for building a tiny home for one of my clients. My skills are perfect for the job, if only I had a way to make that case to recruiters and hiring managers.


If the problem is proof of my abilities, why don't I just make it?


# So what is this site, exactly?


This site will host a mix of the work I've created throughout my freelance career and new work created specifically to showcase my abilities as a writer for prospective employers.

What new work? Half of this website's purpose is to be a Guide for creating and deploying your own website like it. That's right, this website is its own documentation. As I fill in the content and update material, the site's own web pages will contain the step by step process used for making it.

I'll also include my work in animation and writing about my experiences. And attempt some social media marketing as (@HireThisOne)[https://bsky.app/profile/hirethis.one].

Jump in and enjoy the ride.

This site will eventually go live at (https\://HireThis.One)[https://HireThis.One]
